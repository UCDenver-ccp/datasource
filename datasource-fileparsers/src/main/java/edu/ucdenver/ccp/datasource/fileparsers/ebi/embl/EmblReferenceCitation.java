			+ "The RL (Reference Location) line contains the conventional citation \n"

			+ "each issue number. In this case the issue number must be included, and the \n"
			+ "format becomes:\n"
			+ "     RL   journal vol(no):pp-pp(year).\n"
			+ " \n"
			+ "If a paper is in press, the RL line will appear with such information as \n"
			+ "we have available, the missing items appearing as zeros. For example:\n"
			+ "     RL   Nucleic Acids Res. 0:0-0(2004).\n"
			+ "This indicates a paper which will be published in Nucleic Acids Research at some\n"
			+ "point in 2004, for which we have no volume or page information. Such references\n"
			+ "are updated to include the missing information when it becomes available.\n"
			+ "Another variation of the RL line is used for papers found in books \n"
			+ "or other similar publications, which are cited as shown below:\n"
			+ "     RA   Birnstiel M., Portmann R., Busslinger M., Schaffner W.,\n"
			+ "     RA   Probst E., Kressmeann A.;\n"
			+ "     RT   \"Functional organization of the histone genes in the\n"

			+ "     RL   SPECIFIC EUKARYOTIC GENES:117-132;\n"
			+ "     RL   Munksgaard, Copenhagen (1979).\n"
			+ "Note specifically that the line where one would normally encounter the \n"
			+ "journal location is replaced with lines giving the bibliographic citation\n"
			+ "of the book. The first RL line in this case contains the designation \"(in)\",\n"
			+ "which indicates that this is a book reference.\n"
			+ "The following examples illustrate RL line formats that are used for data\n"
			+ "submissions:\n"
			+ "     RL   Submitted (19-NOV-1990) to the EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ databases.\n"
			+ "     RL   M.A. Hughes, UNIVERSITY OF NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE, MEDICAL SCHOOL, NEW\n"
			+ "     RL   CASTLE UPON TYNE, NE2  4HH, UK\n"
			+ "Submitter address is always included in new entries, but some older \n"
			+ "submissions do not have this information. \n"
			+ "RL lines take another form for thesis references. \n"
			+ "For example:\n"
			+ "     RL   Thesis (1999), Department of Genetics,\n"
			+ "     RL   University of Cambridge, Cambridge, U.K.\n"
			+ "For an unpublished reference, the RL line takes the following form:\n"
			+ "     RL   Unpublished.\n"
			+ "Patent references have the following form:\n"
			+ "     RL   Patent number EP0238993-A/3, 30-SEP-1987.\n"
			+ "     RL   BAYER AG.\n"
			+ "The words \"Patent number\" are followed by the patent application number, the\n"
			+ "patent type (separated by a hyphen), the sequence's serial number within the\n"
			+ "patent (separated by a slash) and the patent application date. The subsequent RL\n"
			+ "lines list the patent applicants, normally company names.\n"
			+ "Finally, for journal publications where no ISSN number is available for the\n"
			+ "journal (proceedings and abstracts, for example), the RL line contains the\n"
			+ "designation \"(misc)\" as in the following example.\n"
