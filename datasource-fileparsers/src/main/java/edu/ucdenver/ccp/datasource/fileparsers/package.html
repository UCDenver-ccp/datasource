<p>Provides classes for extracting data records from files and
streams.</p>
<p>These classes rely on files in
edu.ucdenver.ccp.common.file.reader.</p>
<p>FileRecordReader and DataRecordReader distinguish most classes in
this package. Both types of RecordReader serve a similar function, that
being parsing Records out of their input. The main difference between
the two is that the FileRecordReader and its subclasses parse
FileRecords from a File (and only from files). The output FileRecord
includes a pointer to the byte offset for where it starts within the
file. Internally, the FileRecordReader class uses the
edu.ucdenver.ccp.common.file.reader.BufferedRafReader class to track the
location of each record in the File. Because BufferedRafReader is a
subclass of RandomAccessFile it can only take a File as input.</p>
<p>To allow for a somewhat more flexible API we have included the
DataRecordReader and its subclasses. The DataRecordReader performs the
same operations as the FileRecordReader classes with the exception of
tracking the position of the record within the input source. The
DataRecordReader classes rely on the
edu.ucdenver.ccp.common.file.reader.StreamLineReader class instead of
the BufferedRafReader class, and can therefore take as input
InputStreams along with Files.</p>
<p>The "SingleLine" RecordReader classes convert each line
encountered into a Record. The "MultiLine" RecordReader classes allow
for multiple lines to be used to extract a single record.</p>
